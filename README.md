Notes: 
-> We do not save any user generated passwords.
-> Colorama does not belong to me and it's added to the repository because I got some import    error. Your help would be amazing as I'm still a non-professional programer.
-> Generated passwords can be viewed in the empty file generatedPasswords.log. I mean probably    it won't be empty after you generate any password. Do not edit or write anything on this    file.
-> salts.txt is a text file where the program randomly chooses words in the file to add it to       your hashed password. To add some salts to the file make sure you add each salt in a separate
   line.
-> I love you.
