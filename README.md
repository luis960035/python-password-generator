Notes: 
-> Generated passwords are viewable to the client/user only.
-> Colorama is an imported module.
-> Generated passwords can be viewed in the empty file generatedPasswords.log.  probably it won't be empty after you generate any password. Do not edit or write anything on this file.
-> salts.txt is a text file where the program randomly chooses words in the file to add it to your hashed password. To add some salts to the file make sure you add each salt in a  separate line.
